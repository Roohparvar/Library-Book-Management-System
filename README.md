# Library Book Management System

This repository is created as a simple exercise for students who want to advance in **software engineering**, **database management**, and **server-side programming**. The tasks provided here are based on exercises I've given to my students during my classes to help them master the basic concepts of these subjects.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their information, which is stored in a database table.
- **Login and User Panel**: Registered users can log in with their credentials and access their personalized panel.
- **Book List and Reservations**: In the panel, users can:
  - View the list of available books.
  - See the books they have currently reserved.
  - Return previously borrowed books.
  - Borrow new books (note: a user cannot borrow more than 3 books at a time).
- **Admin Access**: There is a special login section for admin users. If a user logs in with the admin password, they can view which user has borrowed each book.
